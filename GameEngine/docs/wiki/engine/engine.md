# Game Engine

The dominate objective of this project is to create a "game-specific" engine,
that can be used to create a video game that enables the most amount of code
reuse, breaks down the structure of the project into bite-sized and understandable
sections, provides meaningful abstractions such that systems can be created to
handle the underlying mechanics without devs needing to understand ever aspect
of the game or engine.

Additionally, I would like this game/development environment to be more plug-and-play
than the original DFTD game. I would like there to be room to grow into proper testing,
tools, and a developement environment/workflow that has minimal dependencies while
keeping the entire project clean, easy to use, and maintainable.
