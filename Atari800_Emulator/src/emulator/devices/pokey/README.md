# POKEY

POKEY is a digital Input/Output chip. It handles such disparate tasks as the serial I/O (SIO) bus and its peripherals, audio generation, keyboard scan, and random number generation. It also digitizes the resistive paddle inputs and controls maskable interrupt (IRQ) requests from peripherals.
